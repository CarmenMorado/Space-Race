# Space-Race
100 Days of Swift (Project 17) A very simple survival game: the player will have to pilot a spaceship safely through a field of space junk and the longer they 
stay alive the higher their score will be. Throughout the course of this project, I learned about pixel-perfect collision detection, Timer, linearDamping, and more.
In addition, I completed the following challenges: 


-Stop the player from cheating by lifting their finger and tapping elsewhere – try implementing touchesEnded() to make it work.


-Make the timer start at one second, but then after 20 enemies have been made subtract 0.1 seconds from it so it’s triggered every 0.9 seconds. After making 20 more, subtract another 0.1, and so on. Note: you should call invalidate() on gameTimer before giving it a new value, otherwise you end up with multiple timers.


-Stop creating space debris after the player has died.
